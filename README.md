# Lynx

⚠️ Project under development ⚠️

## Introduction

<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="resources/lynx.png">

Lynx is a chess engine developed by [@eduherminio](https://github.com/eduherminio).

It's written in C# (.NET 6).

You can find Lynx:

- As a [lichess bot](https://lichess.org/@/Lynx_BOT).

- As a self-contained executable, downloadable from [Releases](https://github.com/lynx-chess/Lynx/releases).

Lichess bot can be played directly, but a chess GUI that supports UCI protocol is needed to play against the self-contained version.

Lynx development is heavily influenced by [`BitBoard Chess Engine in C` YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmN0neTso3Jxh8ZIylk74JpwfiWNI76Cs), where [@maksimKorzh](https://github.com/maksimKorzh) explains how he developed his [BBC](https://github.com/maksimKorzh/bbc) engine.
